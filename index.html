            <p class="mb-4">Most complex and important issues can’t just be solved by bringing more expertise, resources or technology.</p>
<p class="mb-4">People usually have many legitimate reasons to resist change: fear of losses, unripe issue, competing loyalties…</p>
<p class="mb-4">Adaptive leadership is a systemic approach that allows anyone to feel empowered, by better understanding their environment, observing dynamics and identifying opportunities to design effective interventions.</p>

            <h2 class="title text-primary mb-3">Why We Do It</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">We live in a time full of adaptive challenges: climate crisis, political instabilities, world multipolarisation, cultural changes, adoption of technologies fastening...</p>

<p class="mb-4">We are touched by values at stake in the challenges we see in our lives, and we want to do something about it.
However, the traditional way of thinking leadership - centered around notions of authority and charisma - gives us not much hope of progress.</p>

<p class="mb-4">On the contrary, Adaptive Leadership opens up many roads to thrive.
Indeed, mobilizing people and resources for collective work is a very potent way to be part of solutions that can shape our future.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Because it is counterintuitive, adaptive leadership is hard to learn and easy to forget. Our group makes us recall the fundamentals and dig deeper into the theory, month after month.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Moreover, our group is a safe place to experiment and practice leadership. It enables us to grow our adaptive capabilities without taking the risk of being neutralized in our lives.</p>

<p class="mb-4">Finally, the group is preciously helpful when one doubts and feels stuck in an adaptive challenge she is engaged.</p>

<p>I choose my studies in function of what I am passionate about, and to better understand the world around me and not to find a job. I studied history of art, management and public affairs, and today I work in a bank.</p>
<p>My motto is “you must always aim for the moon, because even if you fail, you land among the stars” from Oscar Wilde, it helped me to reach things I have never thought I could do in my life, adaptive leadership is one of them 😉.

            <h3>Leadership Without Easy Answers</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">This book defines Leadership with clarity and patience for the reader. Seeing Leadership as a collective work, all of a sudden a lot of complex situations start to make crystal sense.</p>
            <p>Then the author decline different concepts and strategies to prepare leaders to lead change in organizations, and - most importantly - to stay alive.</p>
            <p>Finally, Heifetz takes the time to discuss the reader's motivations as a leader to tackle adaptive challenges. Making us think this way about our roots, ancestors, values, and all that makes our identity, is invaluable.</p>

                <p>&ldquo;I have found this book <strong>very clear and enlightening</strong>. Even though I had been familiar with Heifeitz's framework for leadership for years with readings from Leadership On The Line, I had deep learnings reading carefully this book. The magic is about delivering that much pedagogy for such a counter-intuitive theory.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>&ldquo;I have joined the Adaptive Leadership Group when I was looking for my first permanent job after graduation, and it was a pretty hard period because it was in 2020 during the Covid Crisis.</p>
<p> I have learned how to better live with people that are different from me and to understand better professional situations.</p>
<p>With this Group <strong>I learn everyday more about myself and how to go out of my comfort zone</strong> but being ok with it even if it is uncomfortable it is always in a benevolent environment so it helps.</p>
<p>You should join the group if you are seeking intellectual stimulation and you want to connect with society and better understand the world that is surrounding you.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>&ldquo;I was 22 when I joined the Adaptive Leadership program, naively thinking that it would be like any training - you go there, meet nice people, hear interesting concepts and leave with catchy takeaways.
<p>It was nothing like that. I mean, I went there and met nice people, even long-lasting relationships.</p>
However, each session was <strong>emotionally intense</strong>, embracing the uncomfortable complexity of human interactions.</p>
<p>Now I have these new glasses that help me focus on group dynamics, hidden factions, holding environment,… instead of assumed personal intentions, anything that prevents you from showing empathy and from looking at the big picture.</p>
<p>This program has <strong>helped me grow</strong> into the soon-to-be 30 y/o woman who <strong>no longer sees her introversion as a weakness</strong>, is able to connect with her purpose and yearns to lead with affirmation and kindness.&rdquo;</p>
